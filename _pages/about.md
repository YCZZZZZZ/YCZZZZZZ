Hi there!👋 I am currently a third-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), advised by Dr. Mohammad Mohammadi Amiri. I obtained a Bachelor's degree from Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology in 2021 and a Master's degree from Washington University in St.Louis (WashU) in 2023.

My research interest lies broadly in the filed of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. I aim to make AI be more intelligent by focusing on enhancing model efficiency and generalizability through both data-centric and model-centric approaches. My current work centers on the fundamental challenge of foundation model generalization, particularly investigating how these models can reliably scale their capabilities. For instance, generalizing to longer sequence lengths or novel compositional structures beyond their training data. Furthermore, I am also interested in investigating Agentic AI for achieving scalable coordination and collective intelligence in complex environments.

The journey is still unfolding, and I’m always eager to connect, collaborate, and learn along the way. Please feel free to reach out to discuss potential research collaborations or shared interests!
